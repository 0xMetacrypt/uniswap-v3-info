## Uniswap Info V3

An open sourced interface for Uniswap V3 Analytics.

Info URL: https://uniswap-v3-info.metacrypt.org

## Why?

- Uniswap decided to deprecate their own Uniswap V3 Info website on June 11th, 2024 with less than 1 week of notice. [See Commit](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-info/commit/43e5b31f1a8a2e47137dd7d08398be7043ccaf98).
- This Analytics interface is still extremely useful for Liquidity Providers on Uniswap V3, their new combined interface lacks specific information.
- Maintaining and Open Sourcing this codebase will allow the community to continue using this interface.
- Deployed with GitHub Pages to ensure it is always available and securely deployed.
